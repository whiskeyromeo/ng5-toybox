This version of the force directed graph is based on [this vanilla js version](https://bl.ocks.org/christianbriggs/c6f283457fc9abb2b88b3393e73d90f0).

I am seeking to transition this model to the compartamentalized version found in **d3-force-layout-v1**
while retaining the functionality of adding and removing elements from the graph.
