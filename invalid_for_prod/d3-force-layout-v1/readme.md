This was initially implemented and then removed as it causes
significant errors when trying to compile to production. 

I have put it here for future reference on possible means of implementing a d3 component
in a modular fashion using services and directives, however I have not yet encountered a particular 
instance where this design would be more useful due to the very customized nature of elements
presented using d3.
